| Matlab(TM) Attitude Tool Kit |
--------------------------------
Version: 0.1 alpha
Release date: 10 August 2006


Overview
--------
This is a set of Matlab(TM) function that implement most of the
important functions in the related technical report:

@misc{Diebel06b,
  author = {James Diebel},
  title	= {Representing Attitude: Euler Angles, Unit Quaternions, and
           Rotation Vectors},
  year = {2006},
  howpublished = {Technical Report},
  note = {http://ai.stanford.edu/~diebel/attitude/attitude.pdf}
}

This technical report details the mathematics required to express the
attitude of rigid bodies in three-dimensional space.  In particular,
we present the various possible parameterizations, as well as the
derivatives of various key results with respect to the attitude
parameters.  Detailed discussions of the relative merits of the
various representations are provided.

The Matlab(TM) code contains help files and uses a uniform naming
scheme that makes it easy to infer the Matlab name of a function given
the name within the technical report.
