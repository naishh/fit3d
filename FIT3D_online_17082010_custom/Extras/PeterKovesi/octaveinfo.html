<h2>Octave</h2>

MATLAB is great, but it is expensive.  GNU Octave is a very
viable alternative.  Octave runs under Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. 

<p> With the release of Octave 3 many of the remaining
incompatibilities between Octave and MATLAB have been eliminated and
the graphics much improved.  Plotting and image display is not as fast
or as polished as it is under MATLAB but you can do pretty well
everything you want to.  Most of your MATLAB code will run under
Octave with no modifications required.

<p> You will also find that Octave has a number of features that are
improvements on MATLAB.  For example you can create stand-alone
executable scripts, you can write sin(x)(1:10); rather than y =
sin(x); y = y([1:10]); and you can specify default argument values for
functions, to name a few.


<!--
In recent times the Octave project has become increasingly active
and a number of toolboxes, including an image processing toolbox, are
being built up.  I have been impressed to find that many of my
functions run under Octave with little or no modification.  Most of
the changes needed are due to the fact that plotting and visualization
of data under Octave are not as well developed as they are under
MATLAB. As far as image processing is concerned the major difficulty
is the inability to overlay plots on an image.  Functions with no
plotting, or simple plotting commands, will often run with no change.

<p>The installation of Octave is straightforward and the installation of
packages (Octave's equivalent of MATLAB toolboxes) has been
streamlined. 

<p> I suggest you check the following links

<ul>

  <li><a href=http://www.octave.org>The Octave home page</a> Download
  Octave and get documentation here.
  
  <li><a href=http://octave.sourceforge.net/>GNU Octave-Forge Package
  Repository</a> Get your packages (toolboxes) here.  I suggest you
  start with the image, signal, optim, plot and miscellaneous
  packages.

  <li><a href=http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?CategoryScriptArchive>The Octave
Script Archive</a> 

<li><a href=http://hpc.sourceforge.net/>HPC Mac OS X</a> A great page
of Mac OS X numerical software.  Here you will find an easily
installed Octave binary for the Mac.  This is what I use.

</ul>

<p>Please do not mail me about any Octave installation problems, I
will not know how to help you. You should refer to the appropriate FAQ
pages.


<h3>A few gotchas to look out for</h3>

<ul>
<li> imwrite under Octave has its arguments reversed relative to MATLAB
<pre>
 > imwrite(filename, image)  % Octave
 > imwrite(image, filename)  % MATLAB
</pre>
However the Octave imwrite function now detects if the arguments are in
'MATLAB order' and swaps them for you so you do not need to worry about this.

<li>Display of colour images can be washed out.  This seems to be
caused by the rgb colormap having only 64 entries.  If I create a 256
element colormap images are displayed fine. At least this is what I
find with my Mac OSX installation.
  
<li> Some image processing toolbox functions test the input image
against the function <tt>isgray</tt> which, if your data is of type
double, only returns true if all values lie in the range [0 1].  If
you get an error message saying your gray scale image is not a gray
scale image you probably need to rescale its values to [0 1].

<li>I have found on odd occasions (that I have difficulty replicating)
that the SVD in 'economy' mode can sometimes be too economical and I
lose a dimension in the decomposed matrices.

<li>The use of 'private' subdirectories does not seem to be supported.
You can, of course, explicitly add the private subdirectory to your
PATH assuming name clashes are not a problem.

<li>Subfunctions within a file do not seem to over-ride public
functions of the same name.  Note this is also a problem in MATLAB
when the public function happens to be a built-in function.

 </ul>


<h3>Notes on code modifications to provide Octave compatibility</h3>

In a few cases I have had to create slightly different execution paths
for Octave and MATLAB.  To detect whether the code is running under
Octave I am using the following test (thanks to Rosen Diankov for this).

<pre>
  Octave = exist('OCTAVE_VERSION') ~= 0;
</pre>

<p>
While MATLAB allows one to pass string arguments to functions without
enclosing quotes and brackets, for example
<pre>
  warning off
  axis equal
</pre>
this is not (always) allowed under Octave.  However, by writing code in the
proper functional form such as
<pre>
  warning('off');
  axis('equal')
</pre>

 compatibility under both MATLAB and Octave can be maintained. With
 Octave 3 this problem is mostly eliminated.

<h3>Historical Stuff</h3>
<!--<h3>Some additional functions to allow execution under Octave </h3>-->

 With the earier versions of Octave there was a bit of fiddling around
 required to get things to work.  I wrote a number of functions to
 allow execution of my code under Octave.  With Octave 3 they are no
 longer needed.  Listed below are a few of these functions, you may
 possibly want the placeholder functions.

 <ul>

   <li><a href=OctaveCode/fspecial.m>fspecial.m</a> replacement for
   MATLAB fspecial. Note the current image package now has an
   implementation of fspecial (which incorporates some of this
   code). This link is just here for historical reference.
  
   <li><a href=OctaveCode/truesize.m>truesize.m</a> Placeholder function that
   does nothing except allow code written for MATLAB handle-graphics to
   at least execute under Octave.

   <li><a href=OctaveCode/pixval.m>pixval.m</a> Placeholder

   <li><a href=OctaveCode/rotate3d.m>rotate3d.m</a> Placeholder
  
   <!--
   <li><a href=OctaveCode/line.m>line.m</a> Minimal implementation of
   MATLAB's LINE function using PLOT.  This is needed for a number of
   functions.

   <li><a href=OctaveCode/show.m>show.m</a> Minimal implementation of
   SHOW so that code that uses my MATLAB function SHOW will at least
   still execute under Octave.

   <li><a href=OctaveCode/set.m>set.m</a> Placeholder function that
   does nothing except allow code written for MATLAB handle-graphics to
   at least execute under Octave.
   <li><a href=OctaveCode/get.m>get.m</a> Placeholder
   <li><a href=OctaveCode/shading.m>shading.m</a> Placeholder
   <li><a href=OctaveCode/box.m>box.m</a> Placeholder
   -->

 </ul>
