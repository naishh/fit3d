<h2>What Are Log-Gabor Filters and Why Are They Good?</h2>


<p>Gabor filters are a traditional choice for obtaining localised
frequency information.  They offer the best simultaneous localization
of spatial and frequency information.  However they have two main
limitations.  The maximum bandwidth of a Gabor filter is limited to
approximately one octave and Gabor filters are not optimal if one is
seeking broad spectral information with maximal spatial localization.

<p>An alternative to the Gabor function is the Log-Gabor function
proposed by Field [1987].  Log-Gabor filters can be constructed with
arbitrary bandwidth and the bandwidth can be optimised to produce a
filter with minimal spatial extent.



<h4>Bandwidth limitations of Gabor filters</h4>

<p>One cannot construct Gabor functions of arbitrarily wide bandwidth and
still maintain a reasonably small DC component in the even-symmetric
filter.  This difficulty can be seen if we look at the transfer
function of an even-symmetric Gabor filter in the frequency domain.
The transfer function is the sum of two Gaussians centred at plus and
minus the centre frequency.  If the standard deviation of
these Gaussians becomes more than about one third of the centre
frequency the tails of the two Gaussians will start to overlap
excessively at the origin, resulting in a nonzero DC component.

</table>
</center>

<p>At the limiting situation where the centre frequency is equal to
three standard deviations, the bandwidth will be approximately one
octave.  This can be seen as follows: For a Gaussian, the points where
its value falls to half the maximum are at approximately plus and
minus one standard deviation, these points defining the cutoff
frequencies.  Thus the upper and lower cut-off frequencies will be at
approximately 4&sigma; and 2&sigma; respectively, giving a bandwidth
of one octave.  This limitation on bandwidth means that we need many
Gabor filters to obtain wide coverage of the spectrum.


<h4>The Log-Gabor Filter</h4>

<p>An alternative to the Gabor function is the log-Gabor function
proposed by Field [1987]. Field suggests that natural images are
better coded by filters that have Gaussian transfer functions when
viewed on the <em>logarithmic</em> frequency scale.  (Gabor functions
have Gaussian transfer functions when viewed on the <em>linear</em>
frequency scale).  On the linear frequency scale the log-Gabor
function has a transfer function of the form

<center>
G(w) = e<sup> (-log(w/w<sub>o</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)  / 
             ( 2 (log(k/w<sub>o</sub>)<sup>2</sup> )
 </sup>

</center>
<!--
\begin{equation}
{\cal G}(\omega) = e^{\frac{- (log (\omega / \omega_{o}))^{2}} 
                {2 (log (\kappa/ \omega_{o}))^{2}}} \ ,
\end{equation}
-->

<p>where w<sub>o</sub> is the filter's centre frequency.  To obtain
constant shape ratio filters the term k/w<sub>o</sub> must also be
held constant for varying w<sub>o</sub>.  For example, a
k/w<sub>o</sub> value of .74 will result in a filter bandwidth of
approximately one octave, .55 will result in two octaves, and .41 will
produce three octaves.

both linear and logarithmic frequency scales.
</table>
</center>


<p>There are two important characteristics to note.  Firstly, log-Gabor
functions, by definition, always have no DC component, and secondly,
the transfer function of the log Gabor function has an extended tail
at the high frequency end.  Field's studies of the statistics of
natural images indicate that natural images have amplitude spectra
that fall off at approximately 1/w.  To encode images having
such spectral characteristics one should use filters having spectra
that are similar.  Field suggests that log Gabor functions, having
extended tails, should be able to encode natural images more
efficiently than, say, ordinary Gabor functions, which would
over-represent the low frequency components and under-represent the
high frequency components in any encoding.  Another point in support
of the log Gabor function is that it is consistent with measurements
on mammalian visual systems which indicate we have cell responses that
are symmetric on the log frequency scale.

<p>What do log Gabor functions look like in the spatial domain?
Unfortunately due to the singularity in the log function at the origin
one cannot construct an analytic expression for the shape of the log
Gabor function in the spatial domain.  One is reduced to designing the
filters in the frequency domain and then performing a numerical
inverse Fourier Transform to see what they look like.  Their
appearance is similar to Gabor functions though their shape becomes
much `sharper' as the bandwidth is increased.  The shapes of log Gabor
and Gabor functions are almost identical for bandwidths less than one
octave.  Shown below are three log Gabor filters of different
bandwidths all tuned to the same centre frequency.

</table>
</center>

<p>Given that we are now able to construct filters of arbitrary bandwidth
and zero DC component the following question arises: What is the best
bandwidth to use?  One observation is that as bandwidth increases so
too does the sharpness of the filter.  Therefore, one constraint might
be imposed by the maximum sharpness of the filter that we can
effectively represent.  Of perhaps greater interest is to study the
variation of the spatial width of filters with bandwidth.  A useful
objective might be to minimize the spatial width of filters in order
to get maximal spatial localization of our frequency information.

<p>Normally when a function is wide in the frequency domain it is narrow
in the spatial domain, thus we expect broad bandwidth filters to be
narrow in the spatial domain.  However, changing the bandwidth of a
log Gabor filter does not result in a simple linear stretch of its
transfer function in the frequency domain, so one's first intuitive
thoughts about their behaviour in the spatial domain can be
misleading. Careful observation of the behaviour of broad bandwidth
log Gabor filters in the spatial domain reveals that while the central
spike(s) of the filter may become very narrow the tails of the filter
become extended.  To investigate this phenomenon further two measures
of filter 'width' were studied.

<ul>
<li> The width required to represent 99% of the spatial filter's absolute 
      area.
<li> The second moment about the centre of the filter with respect to the
   absolute value of the filter.
</ul>

Analytical investigation of these quantities is hampered by the
singularity in the expression for the log Gabor function at the
origin.  Thus, the variation of both these width measures with respect
to bandwidth could only be investigated numerically, and the results
are shown below.

<center>
<table width=50%>
<tr>
<td> <img src=width_vs_bw.png>
<tr><td>
Variation of the spatial width of log Gabor functions with bandwidth
(evaluated numerically).
</table>
</center>

<p>As one can see, both measures of width are minimized when the
bandwidth is about two octaves. The troughs in the curves are very
broad with any value between one and three octaves achieving a near
minimal spatial width.  The data shown above were for even-symmetric
filters.  The results for odd-symmetric filters are similar though
with a more gradual increase in width for bandwidths above three
octaves being observed.  These results have to be treated with some
caution as they are vulnerable to numerical effects; the spatial form
of the filters was calculated via the discrete Fourier transform, and
the width measures are also determined numerically.  The systematic
undulations in the measure of width to represent 99% of the area are
troubling; all attempts to eliminate them were unsuccessful. The
magnitude of these undulations would vary with filter centre frequency
but their locations would remain constant.  A flaw in attempting to
measure the width required to represent 99% of the filter's absolute
area is that one does not know the <em>actual area</em>, all one knows
is the total discrete area in the finite spatial window being
considered.  The data above was obtained using an FFT applied over
1024 points and with filters having a centre frequency of 0.05 (a
wavelength of 20 units).  The aim was to achieve a good discrete
representation of the filter in both spatial and frequency domains,
and also to avoid truncation of the filter tails.  Despite the
concerns one might have over the absolute accuracy of the data, it is
felt that the overall trends of the curves are valid.  It is
interesting to note that the range of bandwidths over which filter
spatial size is near minimum, 1 to 3 octaves, matches well with
measurements obtained on mammalian visual cells.  One should also note
that the spatial width of a 3 octave log Gabor function is
approximately the same as that of a 1 octave Gabor function, clearly
illustrating the ability of the log Gabor function to capture broad
spectral information with a compact spatial filter.

<h2>Efficient Implementation of Convolution of Log-Gabor Filters in
the Frequency Domain</h2>


<p>
I am often asked how the code I use in my functions works.  The code
for constructing the filters and performing the convolution does
appear a bit mysterious.  Here's an attempt at an explanation.</p>

<p>
In the frequency domain the even symmetric filter is represented by
two real-valued log-Gaussian 'bumps' symmetrically placed on each side
of the origin.  The odd-symmetric filter is represented by two
imaginary valued log-Gaussian 'bumps' anti-symmetrically placed on
each side of the origin.</p>

<center>
<img src=evenfilter.png>
<p>Even symmetric filter transfer function</p>
<pre>

</pre>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src=oddfilter.png>
<p>Odd symmetric filter transfer function</p>
</center>

<p>
One can combine the convolution of the even and odd symmetric filters
into the one operation.  Exploiting the linearity of the Fourier
Transform where FFT(A+B) = FFT(A) + FFT(B) we can do the following:
Multiply the FFT of the odd-symmetric filter by i (to make it real
valued) and add it to the FFT of the even symmetric filter.  The
anti-symmetric 'bump' from the odd-symmetric filter will cancel out
the corresponding symmetric bump from the even-symmetric filter.  This
leaves a single 'bump' (multiplied by 2) on the positive side of the
frequency spectrum.</p>

<p>
Thus if we construct a filter in the frequency domain with a single
log-Gabor 'bump' on the positive side of the frequency spectrum we can
consider this filter to be the sum of the FFTs of the even and odd
symmetric filters (with the odd symmetric filter multiplied by i).</p>

<center>
<img src=combinedfilter.png>
</center>

<p>If we perform the convolution by multiplying this frequency domain
filter by the FFT of the image and take the inverse FFT we end up with
the even-symmetric convolution residing in the real part of the result
and the odd-symmetric convolution residing in the imaginary part.</p>

<p>Returning the result in this form is very convenient.  With the
complex values of the the convolution result simultaneously encoding
the magnitude and phase response of the quadrature filters.</p>

<h3>2D Filter Construction</h3>

Following describes extracts of code in <tt>phasecong2</tt>.

<p>The first step is to compute a matrix the same size as the image
where every value of the matrix contains the normalised radius from
the centre on the matrix.  Values range from 0 at the middle to 0.5
at the boundary.
<pre>
  [x,y] = meshgrid([-cols/2:(cols/2-1)]/cols,...
                   [-rows/2:(rows/2-1)]/rows);
  radius = sqrt(x.^2 + y.^2);       % Matrix values contain *normalised* radius 
                                    % values ranging from 0 at the centre to 
                                    % 0.5 at the boundary.
  radius(rows/2+1, cols/2+1) = 1;   % Get rid of the 0 radius value in the middle 
                                    % so that taking the log of the radius will 
                                    % not cause trouble.
</pre>

Filters are constructed in terms of two components.
<ol>
<li> The radial component, which controls the frequency band that the filter
   responds to
<li> The angular component, which controls the orientation that the filter
   responds to.
</ol>
The two components are multiplied together to construct the overall filter.

<p>Here is an example of constructing the radial component of the filter
given some desired filter wavelength.  The bandwidth of the filter is 
controlled by the parameter <tt>sigmaOnf</tt>.

<pre>
  fo = 1.0/wavelength;                  % Centre frequency of filter.

  % The following implements the log-gabor transfer function.
  logGabor = exp((-(log(radius/fo)).^2) / (2 * log(sigmaOnf)^2));  
  logGabor(rows/2+1, cols/2+1) = 0;     % Set the value at the 0 frequency point 
                                        % of the filter back to zero 
                                        % (undo the radius fudge).
</pre>
<center><img src=loggabor.jpg><p>
Radial log-Gabor component of the filter. </center>

A problem is that for small wavelengths the filters can extend into
the higher frequencies in the 'corners' of the FFT, whereas in the
vertical and horizontal directions the filters are cut off by the
boundary. This uneven coverage depending on direction can upset the
normalisation process when calculating phase congrunecy.  To make the
coverage uniform in all directions the filters are multiplied by a
low-pass filter that is as large as possible, yet falls away to zero
at the boundaries.  For most filter scales, other than the highest
frequency ones, this has no appreciable effect on the filter.
Note the application of the low pass filter is only implemented
in phasecong2 (so far).

<pre>
  lp = lowpassfilter([rows,cols],.4,10);   % Radius .4, 'sharpness' 10
  logGabor = logGabor.*lp;                 % Apply low-pass filter
</pre>

<center><table width="10%" border=0 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0><tr>

<td align="top"><img src=loggaborlp.jpg>
<p>Product of low-pass filter and log-Gabor filter (in this case 
it does nothing). </td>
</tr></table></center>

Now we calculate the angular component that controls the orientation
selectivity of the filter. This is simply a Gaussian with respect to
the polar angle around the centre.  The Gaussian is centred at some
angle <tt>angl</tt>, and has standard deviation <tt>thetaSigma</tt>.

<pre>
  theta = atan2(-y,x);              % Matrix values contain polar angle.
                                    % (note -ve y is used to give +ve
                                    % anti-clockwise angles)
  sintheta = sin(theta);
  costheta = cos(theta);

  % For each point in the filter matrix calculate the angular distance from the
  % specified filter orientation.  To overcome the angular wrap-around problem
  % sine difference and cosine difference values are first computed and then
  % the atan2 function is used to determine angular distance.

  ds = sintheta * cos(angl) - costheta * sin(angl);    % Difference in sine.
  dc = costheta * cos(angl) + sintheta * sin(angl);    % Difference in cosine.
  dtheta = abs(atan2(ds,dc));                          % Absolute angular distance.
  spread = exp((-dtheta.^2) / (2 * thetaSigma^2));     % Calculate the angular 
                                                       % filter component.

  filter = spread.*logGabor;                           % Product of the two components.
</pre>

<p>If we take the inverse Fourier Transform of this filter the even-symmetric
component will be in the real part of the result and odd-symmetric
component will be in the imaginary part of the result.

<p>To create filters tuned to other frequencies and oriented in
different directions one simply forms the product between the
appropriate radial and angular spread components - mix and match.

<h2>Design of a Log-Gabor Filter Bank</h2>

A Gabor, or log-Gabor, filter bank does not form an orthogonal basis
set and hence there is no unique or ideal arrangement of the filters.
Thus, the design of a filter bank is somewhat of an art but the
following should give you some guidelines.

<p> One aim is to produce a filter bank that provides even coverage of
the section of the spectrum that you wish to represent.  This can be
achieved by making the overlap of the filter transfer functions
sufficiently large so that when one sums the individual transfer
functions the net result is an even coverage of the spectrum. Thus,
every point in the spectrum ends up being represented equally in the
final result.  For computational reasons one wants to achieve this
even coverage of the spectrum with a minimal number of filters.

<p>A second aim, which conflicts with the first, is to ensure the
outputs of the individual filters in the bank are as independent as
possible.  The whole aim of applying the filter bank is to obtain
information about our signal, if a filter's outputs are highly
correlated with those of its neighbours then we have an inefficient
arrangement of filters that do not provide as much information as they
should.  To achieve independence of output the filters should have
minimal overlap of their transfer functions.

<p>Thus the transfer functions of our filters should have the minimal
overlap necessary to achieve fairly even spectral coverage.



<p>Here are the parameters you have to decide on, several are interdependent.

<ul>
<li>The minimum and maximum frequencies you wish to cover.  

<li>The filter bandwidth to use.

<li>The scaling between centre frequencies of successive filters.

<li>The number of filter scales.

<li>The number of filter orientations to use.

<li>The angular spread of each filter.
</ul>

<h3>Maximum frequency</h3>

<p>The maximum frequency is set by the wavelength of the smallest scale
filter, this is controlled by the parameter <tt>minWaveLength</tt>.
The smallest value you can sensibly use here is the Nyquist wavelength
of 2 pixels, however at this wavelength you will get considerable alaising
and I prefer to keep the minimum value to 3 pixels or above.

<h3>Minimum frequency</h3>

<p>The minimum frequency is set by the wavelength of the largest scale
filter.  This is implicitly defined once you have set the number of
filter scales (<tt>nscale</tt>), the scaling between centre
frequencies of successive filters (<tt>mult</tt>), and the
wavelength of the smallest scale filter.

<pre>
   maximum wavelength = minWavelength * mult^(nscale-1)

   minimum frequency = 1 / maximum wavelength
</pre>


<h3>Filter bandwidth</h3>

<p>The filter bandwidth is set by specifying the ratio of the standard
deviation of the Gaussian describing the log Gabor filter's transfer
function in the log-frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
This is set by the parameter <tt> sigmaOnf </tt>.  The smaller <tt>
sigmaOnf </tt> is the larger the bandwidth of the filter.  I have not
worked out an expression relating <tt>sigmaOnf</tt> to bandwidth, but
empirically a <tt>sigmaOnf</tt> value of 0.75 will result in a filter
with a bandwidth of approximately 1 octave and a value of 0.55 will
result in a bandwidth of roughly 2 octaves.

<!-- add material relating bandwidth to spatial extent -->

<h3>Scaling between centre frequencies</h3>

<p>Having set a filter bandwidth one is then in a position to decide
on the scaling between centre frequencies of successive filters
(<tt>mult</tt>).  It is here one has to play off the conflicting
demands of even spectral coverage and independence of filter output.


<p>Here is a table of values, determined experimentally, that result
in the minimal overlap necessary to achieve fairly even spectral
coverage.
<pre>
 sigmaOnf  .85   mult 1.3
 sigmaOnf  .75   mult 1.6     (bandwidth ~1 octave)
 sigmaOnf  .65   mult 2.1
 sigmaOnf  .55   mult 3       (bandwidth ~2 octaves)
</pre>


<h3>The number of filter orientations</h3>

This, in conjunction with the angular spread of each filter, specifies
the resolution of the orientation information you obtain from the
filters.  I have traditionally used six orientations. 


<h3>The angular spread of each filter</h3>

Here again one plays off the demands of even spectral coverage and
independence of filter output. The angular interval between filter
orientations is fixed by the number of filter orientations.  In the
frequency domain the spread of 2D log-Gabor filter in the angular
direction is simply a Gaussian with respect to the polar angle around
the centre.  The angular overlap of the filter transfer functions is
controlled by the ratio of the angular interval between filter
orientations and the standard deviation of the angular Gaussian
spreading function.  Within the code this ratio is controlled by the
parameter <tt>dThetaOnSigma</tt>. A value of <tt>dThetaOnSigma</tt> =
1.5 results in approximately the minimum overlap needed to get even
spectral coverage.
