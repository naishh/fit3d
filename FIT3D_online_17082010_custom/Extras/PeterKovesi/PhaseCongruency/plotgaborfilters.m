% PLOTGABORFILTERS - Plots log-Gabor filters
%
% The purpose of this code is to see what effect the various parameter
% settings have on the formation of a log-Gabor filter bank.
%
% Usage: [Ffilter, Efilter, Ofilter] = plotgaborfilters(sze,  nscale, norient,...
%                                       minWaveLength, mult, sigmaOnf, dThetaOnSigma)
%
% Arguments:
% Many of the parameters relate to the specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  
%
%   Variable       Suggested   Description
%   name           value
%  ----------------------------------------------------------
%    sze             = 200     Size of image grid on which the filters
%                              are calculated.  Note that the actual size
%                              of the filter is really specified by its
%                              wavelength. 
%    nscale          = 4;      Number of wavelet scales.
%    norient         = 6;      Number of filter orientations.
%    minWaveLength   = 3;      Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult            = 2;      Scaling factor between successive filters.
%    sigmaOnf        = 0.65;   Ratio of the standard deviation of the
%                              Gaussian describing the log Gabor filter's
%                              transfer function in the frequency domain
%                              to the filter center frequency. 
%    dThetaOnSigma   = 1.5;    Ratio of angular interval between filter
%                              orientations and the standard deviation of
%                              the angular Gaussian function used to
%                              construct filters in the freq. plane.
%
% Note regarding the specification of norient: In the default case it is assumed
% that the angles of the filters are evenly spaced at intervals of pi/norient
% around the frequency plane.  If you want to visualize filters at a specific
% set of orientations that are not necessarily evenly spaced you can set the
% orientations by passing a CELL array of orientations as the argument to
% norient. In this case the value supplied for dThetaOnSigma will be used as
% thetaSigma - the angular standard deviation of the filters.  Yes, this is
% an ugly abuse of the argument list, but there it is!
% Example:
% View filters over 3 scales with orientations of -0.3 and +0.3 radians,
% minWaveLength of 6, mult of 2, sigmaOnf of 0.65 and thetaSigma of 0.4 
%   plotgaborfilters2(200, 3, {-.3 .3}, 6, 2, 0.65, 0.4);
%
% Returns:
%    Ffilter - a 2D cell array of filters defined in the frequency domain.
%    Efilter - a 2D cell array of even filters defined in the spatial domain.
%    Ofilter - a 2D cell array of odd filters defined in the spatial domain.
%
%    Ffilter{s,o} = filter for scale s and orientation o.
%    The even and odd filters in the spatial domain for scale s,
%    orientation o, are obtained using.              
%
%    Efilter = ifftshift(real(ifft2(fftshift(filter{s,o}))));
%    Ofilter = ifftshift(imag(ifft2(fftshift(filter{s,o}))));
%
% Plots:
%    Figure 1         -  Sum of the filters in the frequency domain
%    Figure 2         -  Cross sections of Figure 1
%    Figures 3 and 4  -  Surface and intensity plots of filters in the
%                        spatial domain at the smallest and largest
%                        scales respectively.
