<h3>How to cite<br> "MATLAB and Octave Functions for Computer Vision
and Image Processing"</h3>

There do not seem to be any really strong conventions for citing URLs so the
following is just a suggestion

<p>

<blockquote>
P. D. Kovesi. &nbsp MATLAB and Octave Functions for Computer Vision
and Image Processing.<br> School of Computer Science & Software
Engineering, <br> The University of Western Australia. &nbsp Available
from:<br> &lt;http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/research/matlabfns/&gt;.
</blockquote>


<p><bf>BibTeX entry:</bf><br>
<blockquote>
<pre>
@misc {KovesiMATLABCode,
author = "P. D. Kovesi",
title = "{MATLAB} and {Octave} Functions for Computer Vision and Image Processing",
howpublished = "{S}chool of {C}omputer {S}cience \& {S}oftware {E}ngineering,
                {T}he {U}niversity of {W}estern {A}ustralia",
note = "Available from: $<$http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/$\sim$pk/research/matlabfns/$>$",
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Defining a date for a URL can be a bit problematic.  The site
was first created in 2000, but it contains code going back to 1996.
Updates and modifications occur every month or so.
<a href=
http://www.mla.org/publications/style/style_faq/style_faq4>The 
MLA Web citation style</a> suggests that you include the date of
electronic publication, of the latest update, or of posting, and the
date when the researcher accessed the source.  I guess you could say that
the publication date for the site is the year 2000.

% Date of publication, posting, or modification. (In Netscape, use
% "View," "Page Info" to get a "Last Modified" date if no date is given
% in the article itself.)  
% Date when you accessed the site (without a
% period following it).
