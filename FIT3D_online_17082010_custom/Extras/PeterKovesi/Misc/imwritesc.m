% IMWRITESC - Writes an image to file, rescaling if necessary.
%
% Usage:   imwritesc(im,name)
%         
% Floating point image values are rescaled to the range 0-1 so that no
% overflow occurs when writing 8-bit intensity values.  The image format to
% use is determined by MATLAB from the file ending.
% If the image type is of uint8 no rescaling is performed.
