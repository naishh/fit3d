% SHOWLOGFFT - Displays log amplitude spectrum of an fft.
%
% Usage:  showlogfft(ft, figNo)
%
% Arguments:  ft    - Fourier transform to be displayed
%             figNo - Optional figure number to display image in.
%
% The fft is quadrant shifted to place zero frequency at the centre and the
% log of the amplitude displayed (to compress grey values).  An offset of 1
% is added to avoid log(0)
%
% If figNo is omitted a new figure window is created.  If figNo is supplied,
% and the figure exists, the existing window is reused to display the image,
% otherwise a new window is created.
