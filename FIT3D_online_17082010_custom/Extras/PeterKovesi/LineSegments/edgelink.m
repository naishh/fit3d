% EDGELINK - Link edge points in an image into lists
%
% Usage: [edgelist edgeim] = edgelink(im, minlength, location)
%
% Arguments:  im         - Binary edge image, it is assumed that edges
%                          have been thinned.
%             minlength  - Optional minimum edge length of interest, defaults
%                          to 1 if omitted or specified as [].
%             location   - Optional complex valued image holding subpixel
%                          locations of edge points. For any pixel the
%                          real part holds the subpixel row coordinate of
%                          that edge point and the imaginary part holds
%                          the column coordinate.  See NONMAXSUP.  If
%                          this argument is supplied the edgelists will
%                          be formed from the subpixel coordinates,
%                          otherwise the the integer pixel coordinates of
%                          points in 'im' are used.
%
% Returns:  edgelist - a cell array of edge lists in row,column coords in
%                      the form
%                     { [r1 c1   [r1 c1   etc }
%                        r2 c2    ...
%                        ...
%                        rN cN]   ....]   
%
%           edgeim   - Image with pixels labeled with edge number. Note that
%                      this image also includes edges that do not meet the
%                      minimum length specification.  If you want to see just
%                      the edges that meet the specification you should pass
%                      the edgelist to DRAWEDGELIST.
%
%
% This function links edge points together into lists of coordinate pairs.
% Where an edge junction is encountered the list is terminated and a separate
% list is generated for each of the branches.
%
% See also:  DRAWEDGELIST, LINESEG, MAXLINEDEV, CLEANEDGELIST, FINDENDSJUNCTIONS
%
% Bugs: This code has caused me much grief on and off.  I keep discovering cases
% that do not get handled properly. The logic has grown in a way that is less
% structured than I would like.  At the moment I am aware that if there are two
% adjacent junction points things may go a bit astray.
%
% You may find a few edges that are needlessly broken into two, or more,
% segements.  This should be fixed up by CLEANEDGELIST which gets called if
% you specify a non-empty value for minlength.  Use a value of 0 if you want to
% fix this without trimming small edges.
%
% It may be that you encounter problems in the call to CLEANEDGELIST (which
% has perhaps caused me even more grief).  By calling edgelink with just the
% image arguments, or with an empty value for minlength, CLEANEDGELIST will
% not be called, and you will be spared any errors there.

% TRACKEDGE
%
% Function to track all the edge points associated with a start point.  From a
% given starting point it tracks in one direction, storing the coords of the
% edge points in an array and labelling the pixels in the edge image with the
% -ve of their edge number. This continues until no more connected points are
% found, or a junction point is encountered.  At this point the function returns
% to the start point and tracks in the opposite direction.
%
% Usage:   edgepoints = trackedge(rstart, cstart, edgeNo)

% Arguments:   rstart, cstart   - row and column No of starting point
%              edgeNo           - the current edge number
%              minlength        - minimum length of edge to accept
%
% Returns:     edgepoints       - Nx2 array of row and col values for
