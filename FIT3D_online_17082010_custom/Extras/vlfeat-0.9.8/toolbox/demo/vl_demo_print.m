function vl_demo_print(varargin)
% VL_DEMO_PRINT
%   VL_DEMO_PRINT(NAME) print the current figure to the
%   documentation directory with the specified filename.
%
%   VL_DEMO_PRINT(NAME, R) specifies a magnification factor R, which
%   express the figure width relative to the page width. If not
%   specified, R is assumed to be 1/2.
%
%   Remarks:: The figure paper type is set to letter, which is 8.5 x
%     11 inches. When converted for web viewing, images are rasterized
%     at either 75 or 95 DPI, The documentation system converts images
%     to bitmap with a resolution of 75 DPI, which makes a letter size
%     page 637 or 808 pixels large, repsectively.
%
%     In MATLAB font sizes are usually expressed in points, where a
%     point is a 1/72 inch. Thus a 12pt font sampled at 75 DPI is
%     about 12.5 pixels high.
