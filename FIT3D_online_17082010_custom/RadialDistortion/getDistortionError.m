% getDistortionError - Error estimation based on line fitting
%
%
% Computes the error as the sum of the distances between the given p points
% (known to belong to n lines) and the line that is approximated with the
% set of radially corrected points.
%
%
% Input  - X -> (px2xn) p image points known to belong to a lines. Each
%                       line (n in total) is given by n points.
%        - k -> (6x1)   Radial distortion parameters (4) based on ZissermanÂ´s model
%                       (p.135) and center of distortion (2)
%
% Output - d -> (1x1)   Summed distance
