Todolist after meeting Frans, Tjerk, november 9th

Before our next meeting I will focus on:
	Fix projection bug 
	Door/window detection


Projection
	Fix projection bug 
		write down equations and use Leo as consult
	Add occlusion constraint
		if more walls are candidate pick most closest to cameracenter
	consider projecting and measuring in 2D
	
Door/window detection
	Read former research on license plate recognition
	Apply adaboost cascading classifier on building dataset
	Check how it can be used and how it is related to detect the skyline
	Optional:use houghlines of windowbounds to guide the search 

Improve skyline detector
	Drop thresholdsensitive approach, use classification based on color (HSV)
		Inform about Arnouds research on skylinedetection (IMAF)
		take best edge instead of top edge
		SVM
	Use nummeric evaluation
		find out amount of effort of making a ground truth 
		else:measure width of misclassified area's
		optional:generate graph threshold versus error
	
Thesis
	Read and process Frans' comments on thesis
	Process notes of meeting november 9th
	Rewrite alternative roofs
		discuss how and why current work can and cannot classify a rooftype
			discuss view depended issue
		probably best method is using point cloud and fit in 3D


Kind regards,

Tjerk
