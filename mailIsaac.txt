Hi Isaac,

How are you doing?
Can I get some help of you?

I try to get the 3dmap of a new dataset and it doesn't work.

I apply the MotionEstimation and ScaleEstimation from your fit3d toolbox.
MotionEstimation goes fine.
ScaleEstimation stops



I tried it with the RGB images (instead of the black and white images) it  finds more features

COMPUTING SCALE

PROCESSING FRAME 1
Number of features in frame 1: 35
Skipping frame, no 3 frame tracks
PROCESSING FRAME 2
Number of features in frame 2: 45
Number of 3frame matches: 5
Number of 3D points for scaling: 2
PROCESSING FRAME 3
Number of features in frame 3: 198
Number of 3frame matches: 6
Number of 3D points for scaling: 0



>> size(Fplus)

ans =

        2949           9



The images are rectified with the Bougette toolbox
