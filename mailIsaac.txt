Hi Isaac,


I get the plane normal but how do I translate it to the point cloud.
I think it got something to do with the 4rd coord of the ouput of ransacplanefitter
coord 1:3 is the normal



Hi Isaac,

I continued with the sparse point cloud andÂ the results are promissing.
See attachments.

I projected the pointcloud to the Y axis, draw the base of the 3d model by hand
And I let the wall grow in the Y direction. Then I used the normal of the wall to calculate a Rotation matrix.

The windows are almost orthogonal now.
Two artefacts:
1) The image is rotated 7 degrees
2) The windows are not yet fully orthogonal

A quickfix for (1) is an rotation by hand, see attachment.
For (2) I have no solution. Assuming the problem is the sparse point I tried different variations.
By changing the position and angle of the wall.
Non of them fixed the problem.

I think the problem is in assuming the wall to be exactly in the Y direction.
So I let the wall a little bit skew and the result went better.
So the method of growing is good enough for skyline detection but not for this purpose.
Can (and how can I) your method of fitting a plane in a point cloud?
